# Experiment 8: Use Steg-Expose to Detect Hidden Data in Images


## üéØ Aim
To demonstrate the process of detecting steganography (hidden data) in images using the Steg-Expose tool and analyze the results for potential secret messages or embedded files.

---

## üß† Description
Steg-Expose is a specialized steganalysis tool designed to detect steganography in image files.  
This experiment focuses on using Steg-Expose to analyze various image files and determine if they contain hidden data using statistical analysis methods.  
The tool combines multiple steganalysis techniques to identify potential steganographic content effectively.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used
- Steg-Expose  
- Python 3.x  
- Test images (both clean and with hidden data)  
- Terminal / Command Prompt  
- Image manipulation tools (optional, for creating test cases)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed  
- Download StegExpose from GitHub:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/b3dk7/StegExpose.git
  ```
- Prepare test images (both clean and stego images)

---

## üî¨ Procedure

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation and Setup
```bash
cd StegExpose
java -version
java -jar StegExpose.jar -h
```
(Displays StegExpose help menu)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Preparing Test Images
- Collect images for testing:
  - Clean images (no hidden data)
  - Images with known hidden data
  - Suspicious images  
- Create a folder named `testFolder` and place your test images inside.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Image Analysis
```bash
java -jar StegExpose.jar testFolder
```
(Analyzes all images in the folder)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Detection Settings
```bash
stegexpose -t 0.2 suspicious_image.png
stegexpose -csv report.csv image_folder/
```
(Runs analysis with custom threshold and generates a CSV report)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Result Interpretation
| Score Range | Meaning |
|--------------|----------|
| 0.0 ‚Äì 0.2 | Likely Clean |
| 0.2 ‚Äì 0.4 | Suspicious |
| Above 0.4 | High Probability of Hidden Content |

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Process
- Compare StegExpose results with known test cases.  
- Record false positives and false negatives.

## üìä Results

The experiment was successfully conducted using the Steg-Expose tool on a folder named `testFolder`.  
The analysis produced the following output:

| Image Name                      | Status      | Approx. Hidden Data (bytes) |
|----------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| stego_6672108499_8c582a7f9.png  | Suspicious  | 137047                      |
| stego_6676452201_532f0bffe.png  | Suspicious  | 67141                       |
| stego_6677506211_e45d562b65.png | Suspicious  | 114785                      |
